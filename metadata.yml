Title: Entry-way rules (eNTRy) for gram-negative bacteria
Description: "The eNTRy rules are a set of three simple criteria for predicting compound
  accumulation in gram-negative bacteria.\nThese rules were derived from a large dataset
  of compound accumulation in Escherichia coli and have been shown\nto be effective
  in guiding the design of compounds with improved permeability and accumulation in
  gram-negative bacteria.\nThe eNTRy rules state that compounds are more likely to
  accumulate in gram-negative bacteria if they possess the following\nproperties:
  (1) a low globularity (≤ 0.25), (2) a low number of rotatable bonds (≤ 5), and (3)
  the presence of a primary amine group."

Input:
  - Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output:
  - Score
Output Dimension: 3
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: "Three binary outputs indicating whether the compound meets each of
  the eNTRy rules, namely low globularity,\nlow number of rotatable bonds, and presence
  of a primary amine group. A value of 1 indicates that the compound\nmeets the respective
  criterion, while a value of 0 indicates that it does not."
